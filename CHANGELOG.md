## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Help functionality with `-h` and `--help` flags
- Updated README.md to include help usage examples

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-08

### Added
- Initial implementation of `ocat` bash utility
- Core functionality to obscure sensitive data in export files
- Support for different quoting syntaxes:
  - Unquoted: `export VAR=value`
  - Double quoted: `export VAR="value"`
  - Single quoted: `export VAR='value'`
- Smart obscuring logic:
  - Values 8+ characters: show first 4 characters + `<OBSCURED>`
  - Values <8 characters: show only `<OBSCURED>`
- Support for commented export lines (e.g., `# export VAR=value`)
- Default file path: `~/secrets/secret-env-vars.env`
- Command line argument support for custom file paths
- Environment variable `OBSCURE_STRING` for configurable obscuring text
- Comprehensive README.md with:
  - Usage examples
  - Installation instructions
  - Feature overview
  - Security notes
- Test file (`test-exports.env`) with various export formats
- Git repository initialization and version control setup

### Technical Details
- Written in bash with robust regex pattern matching
- Preserves original file integrity (read-only operations)
- Outputs to STDOUT only
- Handles edge cases and various export syntaxes
- Error handling for missing files

### Development Process

- **Development Environment**: macOS Sequoia with zsh shell
- **Version Control**: Git with branch `bash-version-0.1` for stable v0.1
- **Testing**: Manual testing with comprehensive test file
- **Documentation**: Full README.md and inline code comments

### Files Created

- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `test-exports.env` - Test file with various export formats
- `spec.md` - Original specification document
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This changelog file

### Git History
- Initial commit: "Initial implementation of ocat utility v0.1" (commit: 65d5bbe)
- Branch created: `bash-version-0.1` for stable v0.1 release
- Continued development on `main` branch for additional features

## Development Notes

### LLM Attribution
This project was developed with assistance from **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514), an AI assistant by Anthropic. The LLM provided:
- Code implementation and debugging
- Documentation writing
- Best practices guidance
- Git workflow management
- Testing strategy

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Bash Implementation**: Chosen for simplicity and universal availability on Unix-like systems
2. **Regex-based Parsing**: Used bash regex capabilities for robust pattern matching
3. **Read-only Operations**: Ensures original files are never modified for security
4. **Environment Variable Configuration**: Allows customization of obscuring string
5. **STDOUT Output**: Enables piping and redirection for flexible usage

### Future Considerations
- Potential Python or other language implementations
- Additional output formats (JSON, XML)
- Configuration file support
- Integration with secret management systems
